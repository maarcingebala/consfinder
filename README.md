Consfinder
==========
Consfinder is a tool written in order to investigate various aspects of the problem of inconsistency of knowledge and the methods of determining collective knowledge using consensus method.

The theoretical basis of this topic, as well as the formal models of inconsistency of knowledge and consensus methodology implemented in Consfinder were developed by professor Ngoc Thanh Nguyen and described in the work *Advanced Methods for Inconsistent Knowledge Management*, Springer 2008. 

The tool was developed as a part of my master thesis and was mainly used to carry out the research to answer the questions stated in the thesis.
